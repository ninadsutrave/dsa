/**
 * Queues, stacks, trees, graphs are all abstract data types. 
 * They represent an idea of storing and handling data.
 * For eg. queues represent the idea of storing data in a linear manner,
 * and handling enqueue and dequeue operations in FIFO fashion.
 * 
 * But the underlying data structure used for the implementation of a 
 * queue could be a linked list or a static array.
 * 
 * Similarly, a priority queue is an abstract data type that represents
 * the idea of storing of comparable data on basis of a defined priority.
 * The element with the greatest priority maybe removed from the colleciton.
 * 
 * And binary heap is a specific data structure which is most commonly used
 * for the implementation of a priority queue.
 * 
 * Other efficient ways of implementing a priority queue:
 *  • Binary search tree (may have bad performance in worst time 
 *    if the tree is skewed or highly unbalanced)
 *  • Self balancing binary search tree
 *  • Skip list
 *  • Fibonacci heap
