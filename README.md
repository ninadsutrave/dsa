## Guide

This is a collection of pretty much everything you would want to cover while preparing for any DSA style interview.
Note: All solutions are in C++.

#### My genuine advice:

If you want to learn any language thoroughly, in and out, you might want to start implementing all its basic functionalities/data strucutres using simple stuff like arrays and linked lists. In the implementations folder I have implemented C++'s basic STL data strucutres and some other concepts right from the basics. I encourage you to do the same and later cross check your solutions if you want to *ACTUALLY LEARN THE LANGUAGE* and *build your foundation as strong as possible*. 

## Contribution

Problem additions could be an endless task. So let's not dive into that.

However, all the solutions are self written and although well tested might have some errors I might have overlooked. If you find such a case, I shall be grateful if you could drop a PR. I shall review it and merge the changes ASAP.
